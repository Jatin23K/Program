Perfect, Jatin 💼🔥  
Let’s roll into **Day 7: AutoApply Agent** — the final execution step of the JobCraft Crew pipeline.

---

## 🤖 AutoApply Agent – Purpose

### 🎯 **Goal:**
Automatically or semi-automatically **submit applications** using:
- Tailored resume  
- Custom cover letter  
- Job link or platform (e.g., Naukri, LinkedIn)

For now, we'll **simulate the apply process**, and later optionally add:
- 🔐 Login via `Selenium` or `requests`  
- 🧾 Form filling automation

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Implementation

### 📁 `agents/auto_apply_agent.py`

```python
def auto_apply(job_list, tailored_resume, cover_letter):
    print("[AutoApplyAgent] Simulating job applications...\n")

    applied_jobs = []

    for i, job in enumerate(job_list, start=1):
        print(f"Applying to Job #{i}: {job['title']} at {job['company']}")
        print(f"Job Link: {job['link']}")
        print("📄 Submitting tailored resume...")
        print("💌 Sending personalized cover letter...")
        print("✅ Application Simulated!\n")

        applied_jobs.append({
            "title": job["title"],
            "company": job["company"],
            "link": job["link"],
            "status": "Applied"
        })

    return applied_jobs
```

---

### 📁 Sample Jobs Input (from JobSearcher or mock)

```python
# For testing purpose only
def mock_job_list():
    return [
        {"title": "Data Analyst", "company": "Tech Solutions", "link": "https://example.com/job1"},
        {"title": "BI Developer", "company": "InsightPro", "link": "https://example.com/job2"}
    ]
```

---

### 🔁 Add to `main.py`

```python
from agents.auto_apply_agent import auto_apply, mock_job_list

job_list = mock_job_list()

# Simulate applying to jobs
application_logs = auto_apply(
    job_list=job_list,
    tailored_resume=tailored_resume,
    cover_letter=cover_letter
)
```

---

## ✅ Output:

```
[AutoApplyAgent] Simulating job applications...

Applying to Job #1: Data Analyst at Tech Solutions
Job Link: https://example.com/job1
