# 🧠 JobCraft Crew – AI-Powered Job Application System

**JobCraft Crew** is a fully automated AI-based multi-agent system built using [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) and OpenAI. It smartly manages your entire job application process — from resume parsing to job tracking — with minimal human input.

## 🚀 What It Does

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| 🤖 `InfoCollector` | Extracts profile data from your resume, GitHub, and Notion portfolio |
| 🧾 `OverviewBuilder` | Creates a structured summary of your skills, goals, and experience |
| 🔍 `JobSearcher` | Finds the most relevant jobs based on your profile and preferences |
| 🧠 `ResumeTailor` | Customizes your resume content to match each job (format untouched) |
| 💌 `CoverLetterAgent` | Writes personalized, professional cover letters |
| 📤 `AutoApplyAgent` | Simulates the application process (portal automation coming soon) |
| 📊 `TrackerAgent` | Logs all applications into `logs/applications.csv` with timestamps |
