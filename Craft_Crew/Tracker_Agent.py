Let’s wrap it all up, Jatin! 🧾  
We’re now building the final link in the JobCraft Crew chain — the **Tracker Agent** — to record everything your agents apply to.

## 📊 Tracker Agent – Purpose

### 🎯 **Goal:**
Log each job application into a **structured, trackable file**  
Format: `.csv`, Notion DB (future), or GitHub `README`

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Implementation

### 📁 `agents/tracker_agent.py`

```python
import csv
import os
from datetime import datetime

LOG_FILE = "logs/applications.csv"

def track_applications(application_logs):
    print("[TrackerAgent] Logging applications...")

    file_exists = os.path.exists(LOG_FILE)

    with open(LOG_FILE, mode='a', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)

        # Write header if file doesn't exist
        if not file_exists:
            writer.writerow(["Date", "Company", "Job Title", "Link", "Status"])

        # Log each job
        for app in application_logs:
            writer.writerow([
                datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"),
                app["company"],
                app["title"],
                app["link"],
                app["status"]
            ])

    print(f"✅ {len(application_logs)} applications logged to '{LOG_FILE}'")
```

### 🔁 Update `main.py`

```python
from agents.tracker_agent import track_applications

# Track all applications
track_applications(application_logs)
```

---

## 📂 What You Get in `logs/applications.csv`:
```csv

Would you like me to now:
1. Bundle this into a **reusable `main.py` runner script**?
2. Generate a **README.md** for this project?
3. Add enhancements like **Notion/GitHub logging or basic CLI**?

Or just celebrate this win for now? 😄
