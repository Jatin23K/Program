Yes, you're absolutely right, Jatin 👇  
A **realistic job search** — whether AI-based or scraped — must consider **three primary factors**:

---

## 🔍 **Key Inputs for Job Searching:**
### 1. ✅ **Skills**
- Used as **keywords** to match job descriptions  
- E.g., "SQL", "Power BI", "Automation", "Python"

### 2. ✅ **Location**
- Filters jobs to relevant cities or "Remote" only  
- Helps eliminate irrelevant postings

### 3. ✅ **Experience Level**
- Matches titles like:
  - *Entry-level, Fresher, 0-1 years*
  - *Junior, Associate, 1-2 years*
  - *Intermediate, Analyst, 2-4 years*
- Can filter by years: `"experience": 1-2 years`

## 🔧 Let's Update Our `search_jobs()` Function

### 📁 Modify: `agents/job_searcher.py`

```python
def search_jobs(overview_text, skills, location, experience, top_n=5):
    print("[JobSearcher] Searching for jobs using OpenAI...")

    prompt = f"""
You are a job recommendation assistant. Based on the candidate's background, suggest {top_n} job titles and one-line descriptions that match their:

- Skills: {', '.join(skills)}
- Preferred Location: {location}
- Experience: {experience}

Candidate Overview:
{overview_text}

Format:
1. [Job Title] – [One-line job description]
2. ...
    """

    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )

    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
```

---

### 🧠 Update in `main.py`

```python
job_results = search_jobs(
    overview_text=overview_data["overview_text"],
    skills=overview_data["skills"],  # pulled from resume
    location=user_inputs["location"],
    experience="1 year",  # you can dynamically fetch this later
    top_n=5
)

print("\n[Suggested Job Matches]")
print(job_results)
```

---

## 📝 Example Prompt Given to OpenAI:
> Suggest 5 job titles and one-line descriptions for a candidate skilled in Python, SQL, and Power BI, looking for roles in Gurgaon or Remote, with 1 year of experience.

---

## 📦 Output Example:
```
1. Data Analyst – Analyze business trends using SQL and create dashboards in Power BI.
2. Junior Data Engineer – Support ETL workflows and maintain data pipelines.
3. BI Analyst – Visualize and communicate insights to stakeholders using Tableau.
4. Automation Analyst – Use Python and CrewAI to automate internal reporting tasks.
5. Reporting Specialist – Build scheduled reports and analyze KPIs.
```

---

✅ This approach makes the job search **personalized and realistic**, just like a human assistant would do.

Shall we now start building the **ResumeTailor Agent (Day 5)** that will use one of these job descriptions to optimize your resume?
